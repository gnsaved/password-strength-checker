# Password Strength Checker (2 Designs)

This project contains **two different UI designs** of a Password Strength Checker.
Both are simple, fast, and **API-free** (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS).

## Structure

public_html/password-strength-checker/
- index.html  → Landing page (lets you choose Design 1 or Design 2)
- styles.css  → Styles for the landing page selector UI
- design1/    → Design 1 implementation (must contain its own index.html)
- design2/    → Design 2 implementation (must contain its own index.html)

## How to Use (Local)

1. Open `public_html/password-strength-checker/index.html` in your browser.
2. Click **Design 1** or **Design 2** to view the selected version.

## Links

- `./design1/` → opens Design 1
- `./design2/` → opens Design 2

> If you get a 404, confirm:
> - `design1/index.html` exists
> - `design2/index.html` exists

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

If you publish this folder as the root of a GitHub Pages site, the landing page will be:

- `/password-strength-checker/`

And the designs will be:

- `/password-strength-checker/design1/`
- `/password-strength-checker/design2/`

## Notes

The landing page uses a “dual button” selector UI to match a modern showcase style,
so visitors can quickly preview both designs.
